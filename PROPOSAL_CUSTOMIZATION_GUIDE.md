**Penn ID:** [Your Penn ID Number]        ‚Üê CHANGE THIS
**Date:** October 26, 2025                ‚Üê Update if needed
```

### 2. Group Member Organization (Section 6)

If this is a **group project**, add this section at the end of Section 6:

```markdown
### Duties and Responsibilities

- Week 3: Multi-threading implementation support
- Week 4: Final report writing and presentation prep

**[Partner Name 3]:** (Research & Optimization)
- Week 1: Literature review and related work
- Week 2-3: Advanced optimization research (quantization, TensorRT)
- Week 4: Demo video creation and presentation slides
```

If this is a **solo project**, add:

```markdown
### Individual Project Organization

As a solo project, all responsibilities are managed by [Your Name]:
- **Week 1 (Completed):** System setup, baseline implementation, documentation
- **Week 2-3:** Real-time optimization and testing
- **Week 4:** Polish, final documentation, and presentation

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Sections You Can Trim (if over 3 pages)

### Option 1: Condense Section 5 (Preliminary Results)

**Current:** Very detailed with code examples  
**Alternative:** Remove code blocks, keep only metrics

Before (45 lines):
```markdown
**Test 1: Detection Size Reduction**
```python
640√ó640 ‚Üí 320√ó320
Speed: 20ms ‚Üí 10ms (2√ó faster) ‚úÖ
Accuracy: 95.7% ‚Üí 94.2% (1.5% drop) ‚úÖ Acceptable
```
```

After (3 lines):
```markdown
**Detection optimization:** 640√ó640‚Üí320√ó320 resolution achieved 2√ó speedup 
with only 1.5% accuracy drop (95.7%‚Üí94.2%).
```

### Option 2: Merge Sections 3 & 4

Combine "Pipeline and Baseline" with "Improvements" into one section:
- Keep pipeline diagram
- Remove detailed bottleneck table
- Integrate optimization strategies directly

### Option 3: Simplify Timeline (Section 6)

**Current:** Very detailed weekly breakdown  
**Alternative:** High-level milestones only

```markdown
#### Project Phases

**Phase 1 (Completed, Week 1):** Baseline implementation, 4.3 FPS achieved

**Phase 2 (Weeks 2-3):** Real-time optimization
- Face tracking implementation
- Embedding caching
- Model optimization
- Target: 15-20 FPS

**Phase 3 (Week 4):** Testing, documentation, presentation
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking
- Final documentation and demo
- Presentation preparation
```

## üé® Formatting Tips for PDF Conversion

### For Pandoc Conversion:
```bash
# Compact formatting (fits in 3 pages):
pandoc PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md -o proposal.pdf \
  -V geometry:margin=0.6in \
  -V fontsize=10pt \
  -V linestretch=0.95 \
  --columns=80

# Standard formatting (may be 4 pages):
pandoc PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md -o proposal.pdf \
  -V geometry:margin=0.75in \
  -V fontsize=11pt \
  -V linestretch=1.0
```

### For Google Docs:
1. Upload `PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md` to Google Drive
2. Open with Google Docs
3. Adjust:
   - Margins: 0.6" all sides
   - Font: Arial 10pt
   - Line spacing: 1.0
4. Download as PDF

### For LaTeX (Best Quality):
Use the provided `convert_to_pdf.sh` script with custom margins

## üìä What to Emphasize

### Strengths of Your Project:

1. **Real-world problem:** Current systems too slow (4.3 FPS)
2. **Clear goal:** Achieve real-time (15-25 FPS)
3. **Systematic approach:** 3-phase optimization plan
4. **Measurable results:** Quantitative benchmarks
5. **Comprehensive documentation:** 2,300+ lines
6. **Working baseline:** Already functional system

### Key Numbers to Highlight:

- **4.3 FPS ‚Üí 15-25 FPS** (3.5-6√ó improvement)
- **230ms ‚Üí 64ms** per frame
- **3.2 GB** GPU memory (efficient)
- **95.7%** detection accuracy
- **52%** of time in generator (bottleneck identified)

## üéØ Customization by Course Requirements

### If Instructor Emphasizes Research:
Add to Section 4:
```markdown
### Related Work Comparison

**FaceSwap (2018):** Autoencoder-based, slower, lower quality
**FSGAN (2019):** Reenactment focus, not optimized for real-time
**Sber-Swap (2020):** Our baseline, AEI-Net with AAD blocks
**Our Work:** Real-time optimization of Sber-Swap (2025)

**Key Differentiator:** Focus on deployment optimization rather than 
novel architecture, addressing practical real-time constraints.
```

### If Instructor Emphasizes Implementation:
Expand Section 5 with:
```markdown
### Code Architecture

**Repository Structure:**
- 15+ commits with detailed messages
- Modular design for easy extension
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for critical functions

**Engineering Challenges Solved:**
- PyTorch 1.6 ‚Üí 2.2 migration
- NumPy 2.0 compatibility
- InsightFace API changes
- Colab environment constraints
```

### If Instructor Emphasizes Impact:
Add to Section 2:
```markdown
### Broader Impact

**Positive Applications:**
- Education and research
- Entertainment and content creation
- Privacy protection (face anonymization)
- Virtual reality and metaverse

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Potential misuse for deepfakes
- Consent and identity theft concerns
- Mitigation: Watermarking, detection models
- Focus on educational/research applications
```

## üìû Need Help?

If the document is still too long after trimming:

1. **Remove code examples** from Section 5
2. **Condense tables** into paragraph format
3. **Merge Sections 3 & 4** into "System Architecture & Optimization"
4. **Simplify Section 6** to high-level milestones only
5. **Remove Risk Management table** (keep only success criteria)

**Target sections lengths:**
- Section 1: 0.3 pages
- Section 2: 0.4 pages
- Section 3: 0.6 pages
- Section 4: 0.5 pages
- Section 5: 0.7 pages
- Section 6: 0.5 pages
- **Total:** 3.0 pages

## üìù Alternative: Use the Short Version

If you need a guaranteed 3-page document, create a condensed version by:

1. Keeping Sections 1, 2, 6 as-is
2. Merging Sections 3 & 4 (remove detailed tables)
3. Shortening Section 5 to bullet points only

This will comfortably fit in 2.5-3.0 pages.
