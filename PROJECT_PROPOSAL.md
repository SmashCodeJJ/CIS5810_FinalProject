## 1. Project Title and Summary

**Title:** Real-Time Deep Learning Face Swapping with Performance Optimization

**Summary:**

This project implements and optimizes a deep learning-based face swapping system capable of real-time performance. The system uses a multi-model pipeline consisting of SCRFD for face detection, ArcFace for identity encoding, and AEI-Net (Adaptive Embedding Integration Network) for face generation. The core innovation focuses on achieving real-time performance (15-25 FPS) through face tracking, model optimization, and efficient pipeline design, while maintaining high-quality face swap results.

The project addresses the computational bottleneck of current face swapping systems, which typically operate at 4-5 FPS, making them unsuitable for live video applications. By implementing face tracking algorithms, caching techniques, and multi-threading optimization, we aim to achieve a 4-6× speedup, enabling applications in live streaming, video conferencing, and interactive entertainment.

- Single face processing: 230ms (4.3 FPS)
- GPU Memory: 3.2 GB / 16 GB (T4)
- Quality: High (8.5/10 subjective rating)
- Artifacts: Minimal edge seams, good identity preservation

**Bottleneck Analysis:**
| Component | Time (ms) | % Total | Optimization Potential |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| Face Detection | 20 | 9% | High (tracking) |
| Face Alignment | 5 | 2% | Low |

## 4. How to Improve on Baseline Results

### Optimization Strategy

Our optimization approach targets the three major bottlenecks identified in the baseline analysis:

#### 4.1 Face Tracking Implementation (4× speedup)

**Current Bottleneck:** Face detection runs every frame (20ms)

**Solution:** Implement OpenCV tracking algorithms
```python
# Detect face every 5 frames, track in between
if frame_count % 5 == 0:
    bbox = detect_face_scrfd(frame)  # 20ms
    tracker.init(frame, bbox)
else:
    bbox = tracker.update(frame)      # 2ms (10× faster)
```

**Expected Improvement:** 
- Average detection time: 4ms (from 20ms)
- Face detection stage: 5× faster
- Re-detection on tracking failure for robustness

**Tracker Options:**
- KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters): Fast, good accuracy
- CSRT (Discriminative Correlation Filter): More accurate, slightly slower
- MOSSE: Fastest but less robust

#### 4.2 Embedding Caching (50ms saved)

**Current Bottleneck:** Source face embedding computed every frame

**Solution:** Compute source embedding once at initialization
```python
# One-time computation
source_embed = netArc(source_face)  # 50ms (once only)

# Reuse for all frames
for frame in video:
    swapped = G(frame, source_embed)  # No re-computation
```

**Expected Improvement:**
- Eliminate 50ms per frame
- 22% total pipeline speedup
- No quality degradation

#### 4.3 Model Optimization (30ms saved)

**Current Setup:** 2-block AEI-Net generator (120ms)

**Solution:** Use 1-block generator for real-time mode
- Speed: 90ms (1.3× faster)
- Quality: 7.5/10 (slight degradation acceptable for real-time)
- Trade-off analysis: Speed vs. quality user-configurable

#### 4.4 Additional Optimizations

**Resolution Reduction:**
- Detection size: 640×640 → 320×320
- Speed gain: 2× faster detection (10ms)
- Quality impact: Minimal

**Frame Skipping:**
- Process every 2nd frame, display previous for skipped frames
- Effective FPS: 2× increase
- Perceptual quality: Negligible impact at 15+ FPS

**Multi-Threading (Advanced):**
- Separate capture, detection, swap, and display threads
- Expected gain: 1.5× overall speedup
- Implementation complexity: High

### Improved Pipeline Performance Target

**Optimized Pipeline:**
| Component | Baseline | Optimized | Improvement |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Face Detection | 20ms | 4ms | 5× faster |
| Source Embedding | 50ms | 0ms (cached) | ∞ |
| Target Embedding | 50ms | 50ms | - |
| Generator | 120ms | 90ms | 1.3× faster |
| Others | 20ms | 20ms | - |
| **Total** | **230ms** | **64ms** | **3.6× faster** |

**Expected Real-Time Performance:**
- **Phase 1 (Basic):** 8-12 FPS (basic implementation)
- **Phase 2 (Tracking):** 15-18 FPS (with face tracking) ⭐ **Primary Target**
- **Phase 3 (Threading):** 20-25 FPS (fully optimized) ⚠️ **Stretch Goal**

## 5. Preliminary Experiments and Results

### 5.1 Environment Setup and Modernization

**Challenge:** Original Sber-Swap codebase designed for PyTorch 1.6 (2020), incompatible with modern Python 3.12 and Google Colab.

**Actions Taken:**
- Updated `requirements.txt` for PyTorch 2.2.0 compatibility
- Replaced deprecated MXNet with ONNX Runtime for coordinate regression
- Fixed NumPy 2.0 compatibility issues (`np.bool` → `bool`)
- Resolved InsightFace API changes (removed deprecated `threshold` parameter)
- Fixed affine transformation matrix shape issues in face alignment

**Result:** Successfully deployed working pipeline in Google Colab environment.

### 5.2 Baseline Performance Testing

**Test Setup:**
- Platform: Google Colab (T4 GPU, 16GB VRAM)
- Test Images: Celebrity faces (high quality, frontal poses)
- Metrics: Processing time, GPU memory, visual quality

**Results:**

**Image-to-Image Swapping:**
```
Source: Mark Zuckerberg (1024×768)
Target: David Beckham (1024×768)
Processing Time: 1.25 seconds
  - Model Loading: 0.5s (one-time)
  - Face Detection: 0.02s
  - Face Swapping: 0.12s
  - Blending: 0.05s
Output Quality: Excellent
  - Identity Preservation: ✅ High
  - Pose Transfer: ✅ Accurate
  - Lighting Match: ✅ Good
  - Edge Blending: ✅ Smooth
```

**Video Processing:**
```
Target Video: 10 seconds @ 30 FPS (300 frames)
Processing Time: ~70 seconds
Effective FPS: 4.3 FPS
GPU Memory: 3.2 GB / 16 GB
Quality: Consistent across frames
```

### 5.3 Bottleneck Profiling

**Profiling Results:**
```python
Face Detection (SCRFD):        20.3ms  ± 2.1ms
Face Alignment:                 5.1ms  ± 0.3ms
Source ArcFace Embedding:      49.7ms  ± 1.5ms
Target ArcFace Embedding:      50.2ms  ± 1.8ms
AEI-Net Generator:            119.8ms  ± 3.2ms  ← BOTTLENECK
Landmark Detection:            10.1ms  ± 0.8ms
Blending/Warping:              14.9ms  ± 1.1ms
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Pipeline:               230.1ms  ± 5.2ms
```

**Key Finding:** AEI-Net generator accounts for 52% of processing time but cannot be significantly optimized without model redesign or retraining. Therefore, optimization must focus on other stages.

### 5.4 Quality Assessment

**Subjective Quality Evaluation (1-10 scale):**
- Identity Preservation: 9/10 (excellent facial features transfer)
- Pose Accuracy: 9/10 (maintains target pose/angle)
- Lighting Adaptation: 8/10 (mostly matches scene lighting)
- Edge Blending: 8/10 (minor visible seams in extreme angles)
- Color Matching: 7/10 (slight color shifts in challenging lighting)

**Failure Cases Identified:**
- Extreme profile views (>60° angle): Artifacts visible
- Low resolution faces (<100px): Poor detection
- Occluded faces (glasses, masks): Incomplete swaps
- Multiple faces in frame: Slower processing (linear scaling)

### 5.5 Preliminary Optimization Tests

**Test 1: Detection Size Reduction**
```
640×640 → 320×320
Speed: 20ms → 10ms (2× faster) ✅
Accuracy: 95.7% → 94.2% (1.5% drop) ✅ Acceptable
```

**Test 2: Model Size Comparison**
```
3-block generator: 150ms, Quality: 9/10
2-block generator: 120ms, Quality: 8.5/10 ← Current
1-block generator: 90ms, Quality: 7.5/10 ← Real-time candidate
```

**Test 3: Frame Skip Simulation**
```
Process every frame: 4.3 FPS
Process every 2nd frame: 8.6 FPS effective ✅
Perceptual quality: Acceptable for demos
```
